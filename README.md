# BroccoliBottle

**A local, privacy-first productivity SLM task taskbook** that dynamically generates actionable, goal-driven tasks. BroccoliBottle integrates seamlessly with **Markdown-based tools like Obsidian** and runs entirely offline using Microsoft Phi-4 14B via Ollama.

BroccoliBottle is compact, versatile, and packed with valueâ€”helping you stay focused and healthy in your productivity habits. Unlike ChatGPT with Tasks, which currently falls short in many ways, BroccoliBottle goes beyond predefined, static prompts. ChatGPT with Tasks simply runs a preset script intermittently, sending intrusive emails or notifications, and worse, it consumes your precious usage tokens with every run. In contrast, BroccoliBottle is open-source, completely offline, and genuinely actionableâ€”it doesnâ€™t just suggest tasks, it actively updates your tasks.md file, seamlessly integrating into your workflow without interruptions or hidden costs. Itâ€™s productivity done right: smarter, quieter, and fully under your control.

## Automating BroccoliBottle

Make life even easier by automating BroccoliBottle to run on a scheduleâ€”so it silently updates your tasks when you need it most.

### Option 1: Automate with `cron` (macOS)

1. Open the `crontab` editor:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. Add a line to schedule the script. For example:
   - Run every day at 8 AM:
     ```bash
     0 8 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/broccoli_bottle.py
     ```
   - Run every weekday at 8 AM:
     ```bash
     0 8 * * 1-5 /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/broccoli_bottle.py
     ```
   - Run every Monday at 8 AM:
     ```bash
     0 8 * * 1 /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/broccoli_bottle.py
     ```

### Option 2: Automate on Obsidian Launch
Use tools like **Keyboard Maestro** or **Automator** to trigger the script when Obsidian is launched. Imagine opening Obsidian and having your tasks automatically updatedâ€”itâ€™s like starting your day with a fresh, organized plan.

## Example `tasks.md` File

```markdown
# ðŸ“… Daily Tasks
- [ ] e.g. Run 4km today on the treadmill.
- [ ] Write your personal tasks here to stay organized.
- [ ] BroccoliBottle will also automatically suggest up to 3 tasks (or enough to reach 6 total).
- [ ] Stay consistent and check off tasks as you complete them.

# ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- e.g. Train to run a 10km trail by summer.
- Define specific and clear goals to guide BroccoliBottle's suggestions.
- The more detailed your goals, the better the recommendations.
- Use this section to give BroccoliBottle context for your priorities.
```

---

## How It Works

1. **Initialization:** On the first run, BroccoliBottle creates a `tasks.md` file if one doesnâ€™t already exist.
2. **Task Suggestions:** Dynamically generates up to 3 tasks based on your defined goals (or enough to reach 6 total tasks).
3. **Goal Alignment:** Creates suggestions directly tied to your long-term prioritiesâ€”never random, always actionable.

## BroccoliBottle Philosophy

Why "BroccoliBottle"? Because itâ€™s:

- **Nutritious for your productivity:** Like broccoli for your body, BroccoliBottle keeps your workflow healthy and goal-driven.
- **Compact and contained:** A bottle holds everything together neatly, just like how BroccoliBottle keeps your tasks and goals in one organized place.
- **Fresh and versatile:** Whether itâ€™s a quick sip of focus or a full meal of productivity, BroccoliBottle adapts to your needs, just like broccoli in any recipe.
- **Sustainable and self-sufficient:** BroccoliBottle runs offline, just like a reusable bottle that keeps your resources in check.

Think of BroccoliBottle as the perfect blend of structure (the bottle) and growth (the broccoli), giving you everything you need to stay productive and organized without waste.
